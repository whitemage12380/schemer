# README

Schemer is a Ruby on Rails web application designed to track tasks in a manner that is more robust than a simple ToDo application but lighter-weight than a full-blown Agile ticketing system such as JIRA. It uses a basic jQuery framework to handle front-end, and is designed for use with a PostgreSQL database.

This is very much an early work-in-progress. Installation procedure is one of the many missing aspects of this project. Treat this as a code sample for now.
